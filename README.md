# Image-Gallery--Full-Stack-Development-

Technologies Used:- HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL 
 
 
Aim: 
To build a dynamic photo gallery web application that allows users to 
upload, view, and manage images using a user-friendly interface. 
 
 
Problem Statement: 
  Traditional photo storage methods are static and don’t offer much 
flexibility for online viewing or organizing. There's a need for a simple yet 
elegant web-based gallery that supports image uploads, storage, and categorized 
viewing. 
 
 
Technology Description: 
 
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor): 
• PHP is a powerful server-side scripting language designed for web development. 
• It is used in this project to: 
o Handle form submissions (upload, delete, update). 
o Manage file uploads securely (e.g., checking file type and size). 
o Connect and interact with the MySQL database using SQL queries. 
o Generate dynamic content – like displaying images from the database. 
• PHP enables backend logic that runs on the server before the web page is sent to the 
user's browser. 
 
 MySQL: 
• MySQL is a popular relational database management system (RDBMS). 
• It is used to: 
o Store metadata about the uploaded images (e.g., title, filename, upload date). 
o Provide a structured and reliable way to retrieve, update, and delete records. 
o Maintain data consistency and integrity. 
• It integrates seamlessly with PHP through SQL queries. 
 
 XAMPP: 
• XAMPP is an open-source, cross-platform web server solution stack package 
developed by Apache Friends. 
• It includes: 
o Apache – the web server that runs the PHP scripts. 
o MySQL/MariaDB – the database engine. 
o PHP – the language interpreter. 
• XAMPP is used to:

o Run the application locally on a developer’s machine. 
o Simulate a real server environment for development and testing. 
• It provides a simple control panel to manage services like Apache and MySQL. 
 
 HTML (HyperText Markup Language): 
• HTML is used to structure the frontend of the application. 
• It creates the layout of forms, buttons, and image display sections. 
• All form inputs for uploading, editing, and deleting images are built using HTML. 
 
 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): 
• CSS is used to style the application, making the gallery visually appealing. 
• It is used for: 
o Designing the image grid layout. 
o Enhancing the look and feel of buttons, forms, and text. 
o Making the UI responsive and attractive. 
 
  SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM: 
 
To overcome the difficulties of organizing and displaying photos efficiently, this 
project provides a simple yet powerful Photo Gallery Web Application built using PHP, 
MySQL, and XAMPP. 
              1. Image Upload and Storage: Users can easily upload images which are securely 
stored in a dedicated folder, while the image metadata like title and upload date is saved in a 
MySQL database. 
             2. Dynamic Gallery Display: The images are dynamically fetched and displayed in a 
user-friendly gallery layout, making it visually appealing and easily accessible without 
manual updates. 
             3. Localhost-based Solution: By using XAMPP, the system runs entirely on a local 
server, making it cost-effective, fast, and independent of any third-party platform, while also 
being easily scalable for future features like user login or album categorization.
